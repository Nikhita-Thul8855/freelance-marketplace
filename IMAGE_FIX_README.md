# Image Display Fix

## Problem
Images were not displaying when viewing gigs because the frontend was trying to load images from the React dev server (port 3000) instead of the backend server (port 5000).

## Root Cause
- Server stores image paths as `/uploads/filename.jpg`
- Frontend uses these paths directly without prepending the server base URL
- Result: Images load from `http://localhost:3000/uploads/filename.jpg` instead of `http://localhost:5000/uploads/filename.jpg`

## Solution
Created a utility function `getImageUrl()` that:
1. Checks if the image path is already a full URL (for Cloudinary images)
2. If not, prepends the server base URL to local image paths
3. Handles environment configuration properly

## Files Modified
- `client/src/utils/imageUtils.js` - New utility function
- `client/src/components/GigDetails.js` - Updated to use getImageUrl()
- `client/src/components/GigList.js` - Updated to use getImageUrl()  
- `client/src/components/MyGigs.js` - Updated to use getImageUrl()

## How It Works
```javascript
// Before: src="/uploads/image.jpg" (loads from frontend server)
// After: src="http://localhost:5000/uploads/image.jpg" (loads from backend server)
```

The function automatically handles both local development and production environments based on the `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable.
